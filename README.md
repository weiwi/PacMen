# Pacmen
This is a project based on xpro example.

Here's how the game is played:

When you click the "Add PacMen" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

Future improvement include change the direction of the PacMen after it collides on the wall.
